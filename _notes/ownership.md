title:  "Ownership"

This note shall become the property of the human world once it touches ground in the human world.

The owner of a Death Note can recognize the image and voice of the original owner a Shinigami, for example.

The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its Shinigami owner, even if the human is not the owner of the note.

Whenever a Shinigami in the human world dies and leaves behind its Death Note, the note's finder automatically becomes the owner. However, in this case, only a human who can see and hear that Shinigami is able to see and touch the Death Note. It is very unlikely, but if by any chance another Shinigami picks up the Death Note, that Shinigami becomes the owner.

## Situations Surrounding Ownership

If you lose the Death Note or have it stolen, you will lose its ownership unless you can retrieve it within 490 days.

When the owner of the Death Note dies while the note is on loan, its ownership will be transferred to the person who is holding it at that time. If the Death Note is stolen and the owner is killed by the thief, its ownership will automatically be transferred to the thief.

The individuals who lose ownership of a Death Note will also lose their memories of it. However, this does not mean that they will lose all memories from the period of ownership: they will only lose the memories involving the Death Note.

When an individual with ownership of more than two Death Notes loses possession of one of them, he will no longer be able to recognize or hear that Death Note's Shinigami anymore. The Shinigami will leave, but all the memories involving the Death Note will remain to the owner as long as he maintains ownership of at least one other Death Note.

If a person loses possession of a Death Note he will not recognize its Shinigami by sight or voice anymore. However, if the owner lets someone else touch that Death Note, from that time on that person will continue to recognize the Shinigami's appearance and voice until he or she actually becomes the owner of the Death Note and subsequently loses possession of it.

When regaining ownership of a Death Note, the memories associated with it will also return. In cases where the owner was involved with other Death Notes as well, memories of all the Death Notes involved will return. The memories will return just by touching the Death Note, even without obtaining ownership of it.

Memories related to a Death Note are lost when its ownership is lost. But they may be regained by either obtaining ownership once again or by touching the Death Note. This can be done up to six times per Death Note. Any times more than that, the person's memory of the Death Note will not return and they will have to use it without any previous memory of it.

Even if you do not actually possess the Death Note, you may still use it to full effect.

You may lend the Death Note to another person while maintaining its ownership. The borrower may lend it to yet another person as well.

The person who borrows the Death Note will not be followed by a Shinigami. The Shinigami always remains with the owner of the Death Note. Also, the borrower cannot trade for the Shinigami Eyes.

Only by touching each other's Death Notes can owners recognize the appearance or voice of each other's Shinigami.

Losing memory of the Death Note by passing the ownership to another or by abandoning ownership will only occur when someone is actually killed using that Death Note. You will not lose memory of the Death Note if, for example, you merely owned it and did not write down anyone's name. In this case, you will not be able to hear or see the Shinigami anymore. You will also lose the power of the Shinigami Eyes if you made the trade.

## Multiple Notebooks

Someone possessing more than one Death Note may write down a victim's name in one of the Death Notes and the cause of death in the other, and the death will still occur. The order of writing, however, is unimportant: if you write down the cause of death in one Death Note and afterward write the name in the other, the death will occur. This can be accomplished by two Death Note owners working together. In this case, it's necessary that the two touch each other's Death Notes.

Only six Death Notes are allowed to exist at a time in the human world. Of course, the Death Notes that the Shinigami own do not count. This means only six Shinigami that have passed on their Death Notes to humans can be in the human world at once.

One Shinigami is allowed to pass on Death Notes to only three humans at a time. However, it is possible for a single Shinigami to hand out up to six Death Notes by handing three humans two Death Notes each, for example. In other words, one human could potentially own all six Death Notes.

If a seventh Death Note is given to a human when six already exist in the human world, nothing will happen when it is used.

In the event that there are more than six Death Notes in the human world, only the first six Death Notes that have been delivered to humans will have effect. The seventh Death Note will not become active until one of the other six Death Notes is destroyed or a Shinigami takes one of them back to the Shinigami realm.
